# Incident Data Analysis Dashboard

This is a Streamlit-based data analysis dashboard for visualizing and analyzing incident data. The code allows you to load a dataset, explore it, and generate various visualizations to gain insights from the data.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- Streamlit
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/incident-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd incident-data-analysis
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. You will be presented with a Streamlit web interface to upload your incident data in CSV format. After uploading the data, the dashboard will display various analyses and visualizations, including:

   - Number of events
   - Types of injuries
   - Incidents by gender
   - Summary statistics for age
   - Incidents by region
   - Unique places of residence by region
   - Average age by region
   - Types of injuries in a pie chart
   - Incidents in a specific region with specific characteristics
   - Average age of specific nationalities involved in specific injuries
   - Time-based analysis of events
   - Average age for female and male citizens
   - Gender and nationality injury type

## Data

The code assumes that you have a CSV dataset with incident data. You can either specify the path to your dataset in the code or use the sidebar to upload a CSV file.
